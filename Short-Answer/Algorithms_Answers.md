#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This algorithm runs in linear or O(n) time. You're adding n^2 to a until a is >= n^3. You have to add n^2 n times to get n^3 so the algorithm will always run n times.


b) The algorithm runs in log or O(log(n)) time. J doubles in size in every iteration so n would need to double to force an extra iteration. 


c) This algorithm runs in linear or O(n) time. If you increase bunnies by 1, the number of recursive calls also increases by 1.
